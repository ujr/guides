# Coding Guidelines

This repository contains guidelines for coding and writing.
Guidelines are meant to be helpful for practical work by
establishing a common style and suggesting best practices;
they are not strict rules; they depend on circumstances
and context.

These guidelines have been assembled from practical
experience and after consulting various Internet sources.
They certainly have a subjective touch. Completeness
is not an aim—rather this repository is just a container
for the materials that accumulate from pursuing my work.
Feel free to adapt and use them as you see fit.

  In my humble experience, avoid tabs in favor of spaces, and
  “const poisoning” is not as bad as it sounds.
