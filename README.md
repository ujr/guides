# Coding Guidelines

This repository contains guidelines for coding and writing.
Guidelines are meant to be helpful for practical work by
establishing a common style and suggesting best practices;
they are not strict rules; they depend on circumstances
and context.

These guidelines have been assembled from practical
experience and after consulting various Internet sources.
They certainly have a subjective touch. Completeness
is not an aimâ€”rather this repository is just a container
for the materials that accumulate from pursuing my work.
Feel free to adapt and use them as you see fit.
