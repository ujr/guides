# Programming Culture

As with all trades, there is some “culture” associated
with software programming. Here is a small selection of
works that are considered part of this culture by most
folks, some may only by small groups. No doubt that there
are many more.

There are, of course, jokes, some being quite inscrutable
to non-programmers. Like this one: “There are only 10 kinds
of people in the world, those who understand binary and
those that don't.” Or this one: “Why do programmers always
confuse Halloween with Christmas? Because Oct 31 = Dec 25.”
You know you're a programmer if your favourite hangout place
is the Foo Bar. Programmers are reflective people, critical
of their own work: “99 little bugs in my code; 99 little bugs
in my code; take one down and build it again; 127 little bugs
in my code...”

The xkcd comics series by Randall Munroe are widely enjoyed amongst
programmers; see them at <https://xkcd.com/>.

A famous short program is know as “10 PRINT” and reads as
follows: `10 PRINT CHR$(205.5+RND(1)); : GOTO 10` (Basic).
The output it generates on a terminal looks like maze-like
patterns. An entire book is dedicated to this little thingy.

[The Jargon File][jargon] is a dictionary of hacker jargon,
where hacker is understood in the positive sense of a creative
technical person. The print version is called
*The New Hacker's Dictionary* (Raymonds, ed., 1996,
[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0262680920)).

Is software programming an engineering discipline, a science,
an art, or just a craftsmanship? If you think it's the latter,
see the [Manifesto for Software Craftsmanship][msc]. Seeing it
as an art goes back to [Knuth's Art of Computer Programming][taocp]
books.
