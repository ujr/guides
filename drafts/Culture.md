# Programming Culture

As with all trades, there is some “culture” associated
with software programming. Here is a small selection of
works that are considered part of this culture by most
folks, some may only by small groups. No doubt that there
are many more.

The xkcd comics series by Randall Munroe are widely enjoyed amongst
programmers; see them at <https://xkcd.com/>.

[The Jargon File][jargon] is a dictionary of hacker jargon,
where hacker is understood in the positive sense of a creative
technical person. The print version is called
*The New Hacker's Dictionary* (Raymonds, ed., 1996,
[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0262680920)).

Is software programming an engineering discipline, a science,
an art, or just a craftsmanship? If you think it's the latter,
see the [Manifesto for Software Craftsmanship][msc]. Seeing it
as an art goes back to [Knuth's Art of Computer Programming][taocp]
books.
