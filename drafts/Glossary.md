# Glossary

This document collects definitions of common concepts,
terms, abbreviations, and acronyms, that are related
to software programming in general.

The idea is that you can link here from your project documentation,
or copy relevant entries into your project documentation. Within
your project documentation, you probably want to add terms from
your project's application domain.

## Abbreviations

Software programming abounds with abbreviations and acronyms.
Here is an alphabetical list of general abbreviations; those
relating to specific technologies have not been included.

By the way, abbreviations (lat. *brevis* = short) are shortened
representations of one or several words in a general sense.
There are several types of abbreviations, including contractions
created by omitting syllables (e.g. nil for lat. *nihil*) and
acronyms consisting of the initial parts of a longer word or
several words (e.g. BIOS for *Basic Input/Output System*
or Radar for *radio detection and ranging*
or GNU for *GNU's Not Unix* with its jocular recursion).
There is some dispute whether or not an acronym has to be
pronouncable as a word, though this depends on the language.
In English, for example, GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) is
nicely pronouncable, but PNG (Portable Network Graphics) is not.

Software programming and computer science in general abound
with acronyms to a point where people start making fun of it
and talk of *yet another TLA* (Three-Letter-Acronym).

**API** = Application Programming Interface, ... (vs ABI)

**CI/CD** = Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment, ...

**DDD** = Domain Driven Design, after the 2003 book of the same
name by Eric Evans. ...

**DI** = Dependency Injection, a mechanism for separating construction
from use; implemented as IoC containers.

**DSL** = Domain-specific Language, either a small scripting language
or an API in the main development language that approaches the language
of a domain expert.

**GoF** = Gang of Four, after the four authors of ...

**IDE** = Integrated Development Environment, ... vs Editor, ...

**MVP** = Minimum Viable Product, provides just enough features
to be usable by early adopters who then provide feedback to drive
further development.

**POCO** = Plain Old CLR Object  
**POJO** = Plain Old Java Object, an ordinary object,
without any special attributes nor special inheritance, thus not
following any special conventions besides those imposed by the
runtime (CLR or JVM) itself. Plain Old Objects are a good thing!

**REST** = ...

**SDK** = Software Development Kit, ...

**TDD** = Test Driven Development: write tests and business code
together, tests being just slightly ahead. Keep the system working
(all tests succeed) at all times, even during large refactorings.

**TL;DR** = Too Long; Didn't Read. Used (a) to introduce a short
summary of a lengthy text, and (b) to indicate that you did not read
such a text.

**TODO** = To Do, a comment in code that something needs review;
e.g. `/* TODO dirty hack */`

**UI/UX** = User Interface / User Experience, ...

**Waterfall** = ...

**XP** = Extreme Programming, a software development methodology, ...
