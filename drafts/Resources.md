## DevOps

DevOps is the combination of development and operation.
The idea is to provide a continuous flow of customer value.
It requires complete automation of build and deployment:
Build, Test, Package, Release, Deploy, Configure, Monitor.

## Certifications

Beware that there are usually commercial interests behind
a certification. Consequently, there is a plenitude of
certifications on offer, mostly from big software companies.
Here is a very small and mostly random selection.

- <https://www.isaqb.org> training and certification for software architects
- <https://www.lpi.org> The Linux Professional Institute
- <https://scrum.org> offers Scrum certifications
- Microsoft, AWS, etc.
